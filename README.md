# Project: Memory Box - Random Phrase Display

## Description
This project is an initial draft for a larger application that displays random phrases from a text file. The main idea is to apply this concept to a platform or a device like the **Raspberry Pi Zero** with an **e-Paper display**, creating a "Memory Box" that automatically updates phrases at defined time intervals.

## Features
- Reads phrases from a text file (`phrases.txt`).
- Selects and displays a random phrase at a defined time interval.
- Avoids repeating the last displayed phrase.
- Displays the date and time of the last update.
- Dynamically updates the terminal without scrolling.
